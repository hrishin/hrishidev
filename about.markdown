An engineer passionate about solving infrastructure and operations problems using distributed systems. 
Keen on building sustainable solutions and systems with great user experience as they scale to any degree using technologies 
spanning Linux, containers deployed on-prem and cloud.

Recently my interest has grown significantly toward building systems for low latency trading and HPC systems.
